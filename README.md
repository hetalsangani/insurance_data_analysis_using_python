# Insurance Data Analysis

# Description

An insurance agency, ABC Insurance, has a large dataset containing information about their policyholders and claims. They want to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on this dataset to gain insights that can help them make better business decisions and improve their operations.

The agency wants to analyze the different body types and the environment that affect the premium. The disease's effect or the cost of treatment differs depending on the circumstances. For example, a smoker's medical insurance premium may be higher than that of a healthy person, because smokers are more likely to develop chronic diseases. The agency wants to analyze the data to research healthcare premium costs.
